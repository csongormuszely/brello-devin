# Brello Backend Issues and Solutions

## 1. Login Functionality
### Issue:
The backend lacks endpoints for user authentication, including login and signup.

### Solution:
Implement the following endpoints:
- POST /auth/signup: For user registration
- POST /auth/login: For user login
- GET /auth/confirm/{token}: For email confirmation

## 2. Board Creation
### Issue:
The backend lacks endpoints for board management.

### Solution:
Implement the following endpoints:
- POST /boards: Create a new board
- GET /boards: Retrieve all boards for a user
- GET /boards/{id}: Retrieve a specific board
- PUT /boards/{id}: Update a board
- DELETE /boards/{id}: Delete a board

## 3. To-Do List and Task Management
### Issue:
The backend lacks endpoints for managing to-do lists and tasks within boards.

### Solution:
Implement the following endpoints:
- POST /boards/{board_id}/lists: Create a new to-do list
- GET /boards/{board_id}/lists: Retrieve all lists for a board
- PUT /boards/{board_id}/lists/{list_id}: Update a list
- DELETE /boards/{board_id}/lists/{list_id}: Delete a list
- POST /lists/{list_id}/tasks: Create a new task
- GET /lists/{list_id}/tasks: Retrieve all tasks for a list
- PUT /tasks/{task_id}: Update a task
- DELETE /tasks/{task_id}: Delete a task

## 4. User Authentication and Authorization
### Issue:
The backend lacks user authentication and authorization mechanisms.

### Solution:
- Implement JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication
- Add middleware to protect routes that require authentication
- Implement role-based access control for board sharing

## 5. Database Integration
### Issue:
The backend is not connected to a database for persistent storage.

### Solution:
- Set up a PostgreSQL database
- Implement database models for User, Board, List, and Task
- Use SQLAlchemy as an ORM for database operations

## 6. Email Confirmation
### Issue:
The backend lacks email confirmation functionality for user signup.

### Solution:
- Integrate an email service (e.g., SendGrid)
- Implement email sending functionality for confirmation emails
- Create an endpoint to handle email confirmation

## Next Steps:
1. Set up the project structure for the backend
2. Implement database models and migrations
3. Create authentication endpoints and middleware
4. Implement board, list, and task management endpoints
5. Add email confirmation functionality
6. Test all endpoints thoroughly
7. Update the frontend to use the new backend endpoints
